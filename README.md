# 4ME302_pre-aassignment

***Description***: The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with the assignment submission
procedure and exercise your skills in basic coding tasks.

Your task in this exercise will be to write a JavaScript code that will convert temperatures from
Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. You should also create a user interface to support such
actions, i.e., the user should be provided with UI element(s) to input one of the values (°C or °F).
If temperatures are below 4°C (or 39.2°F) the results should be shown in blue color. If the
temperatures is larger than 4°C and lower than 27°C (or 80.6°F) the font should be black. For,
temperatures above 27°C, the font should be red.

***Formulas***:
● Fahrenheit to Celsius : °C = (°F − 32) ÷ 1.8
● Celsius to Fahrenheit : °F = (°C × 1.8) + 32

***Note***:
You may not just copy & paste a code found online, as that is considered cheating. The source
code should be commented and explained thoroughly. Try your best to come up with your own
solution.

***Submission***:
The assignment should be solved and done individually. We know that inline javascript and css
is not the best practice, but only for this assignment you should include them in the
firstname_lastname.html file and upload it to the specific folder connected to this assignment in
the Moodle platform.
Please note that the deadline is firm and no extensions will be available, unless specified due to
critical reasons. Good luck with your pre-assignment!
